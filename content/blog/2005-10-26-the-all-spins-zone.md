The engineers at Cyberkrunk Labs need to keep their audio equipment calibrated with contemporaneous vibrations and are therefore always on the lookout for new sonic material. Some recent entries include the Kasabian debut, relatively well received, and the latest Weezer, which was almost spat out. Both Franz Ferdinand discs were recently submitted and the results were surprisingly good. The Postal Service was also entered, and once again the meters hit the correct zone.

At the same time, older reference material serves as a good baseline and we couldn't be happier with the tests we have performed on Richard Hell and the Voidoids' _Blank Generation_ album. The machine hummed and sputtered, then outputted on the teletype interface "Where has this been hiding all my life? More!"

Sonically, the Voidoids fall almost precisely between Television (whom we love dearly) and The Clash. But unlike either, they are funny. To wit:

_Love comes in spurts Oh no! It hurts!_

This track weighs in at 1:59, not a second too long, practically begging you to play it again. You will either hate this record for its sophomoric crudity or love it for the same reasons. Was 1977 the apex of American pop music?

At the same time, it is always good to re-acquaint the monster cable with Gang of Four's _Entertainment_. Their resurgence was almost guaranteed following the anthrax scare of '01. And they're touring, too. I just read that they were doing a date in Brooklyn. That's near New York, isn't it?

Now, let's hear that song again...
