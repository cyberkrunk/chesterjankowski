_(Backwards blogging until I get caught up.)_

When Elizabeth and Richard were in town in 1963 filming [Cleopatra](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0056937/), they used to eat often at [Taverna Flavia](https://tavernaflavia.it/en/). Good enough reason to try it out? Not really, but we wanted something in the [hood](http://www.roma2000.it/zveneto.html) that wasn’t lousy with Americans. This place fit the bill perfectly. Not a word of English in sight. NAM’s Elizabeth salad—buffalo mozzarella, shrimp, cherry tomatoes (the kind with flavour, which is generally what they have in Roma) on a bed of arugula—was good, as was my swordfish & rocket. The swordfish was smoked and sliced thinly, (just like yesterday’s smoked tuna at [Cul de Sac](https://www.cntraveler.com/bars/rome/cul-de-sac), but you’ll have to wait to hear about that. The [Vermentino](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vermentino) I ordered turned out to be gone, so we made do with a nice [Collio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collio_Goriziano) Chardonnay instead. For primi, NAM had rigatoni with pesto and tomatoes, and I had a kick-ass [cacio e peppe](http://www.annamariavolpi.com/cacio_e_pepe.html) (which I have not yet had at the New York restaurant of the [same name](http://www.cacioepepe.com/), but which I will now have to try). Fruit, coffee, perfetto. Back into the 31C furnace.
