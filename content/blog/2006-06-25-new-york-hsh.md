_Many years since I was here, on the street I was passin' my time away to the left and to the right, buildings towering to the sky it's outta sight in the dead of night

Here I am, and in this city, with a fistful of dollars And baby, you'd better believe it

I'm back, back in the new york groove I'm back, back in the new york groove I'm back, back in the new york groove Back in the new york groove, in the new york groove

In the back of my cadillac A wicked lady, sittin' by my side, sayin where are we? Stop at third and forty-three, exit to the night It's gonna be ecstasy, this place was meant for me

Feels so good tonight, who cares about tomorrow So baby, you'd better believe

I'm back, back in the new york groove...
