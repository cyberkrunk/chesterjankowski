*Many years since I was here, on the street I was passin’  my time away to the left and to the right, buildings towering to the sky, it’s outta sight in the dead of night*

*Here I am, and in this city, with a fistful of dollars, and baby, you’d better believe it*

*I’m back, back in the New York groove I’m back, back in the New York groove*

*I’m back, back in the New York groove Back in the New York groove, in the New York groove*

*In the back of my Cadillac A wicked lady, sittin’ by my side, sayin where are we? Stop at third and forty-three, exit to the night, it’s gonna be ecstasy, this place was meant for me*

*Feels so good tonight, who cares about tomorrow, so baby, you’d better believe*

*I’m back, back in the New York groove...*
