We were actually looking for Da Baffetto, which turns out not to open for lunch. Instead, we headed into [Cul de Sac](http://travel2.nytimes.com/top/features/travel/destinations/europe/italy/rome/restaurant_details.html?vid=1083747044792), an enoteca near Piazza Navona. Started with some black olives (again) and some great shaved smoked tuna. Might mistake it for ham if you saw it on the plate. Delicious! Then I had the [salt cod brandade](http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1216/is_5_213/ai_n6359133) while NAM feasted on a salad with beans, tomatoes and Italian tuna. Great! We started off with a couple of whites, I had a lovely [Vermentino](http://www.milioni.com/vini/ingd1/608.htm) from [Sardinia](http://www.wineweb.com/map_italy_sardinia.html). After that, I wanted to try their best [super Tuscans](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chianti#Super_Tuscans), but after tasting it, I opted against it. Had some very obvious oxidation on the nose. The dude disagreed, but suggested the Chianti instead, which was absolutely killer and half the price.
