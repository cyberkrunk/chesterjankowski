A while back, I wrote a piece singing the praises of [CSS](http://blog.cyberkrunk.com:8081/?p=13), a great technology for developing web content. Now, I'm passing on the tip about [RSS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS_%28file_format%29), a great technology for accessing web content. RSS, and it's first-born son, Atom, are feed technologies that generate updated XML whenever a web site posts updates. You can view this XML directly of course, but the real payoff is to aggregate all your favorite feeds into a single view. Now you can instantly scan all of your daily blogs in a single session.

How to do it? Well, for starters, you _are_ using [Firefox](http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/), aren't you? Start out with Firefox's Live Bookmarks. This may be all you need. You won't see all your feeds in a single view, but you can do a very quick scan. Really want to see everything in a single pane? You can add feeds to both [My Yahoo](http://my.yahoo.com/) and [Google](http://www.google.com/ig). Or, you can use [Newsgator](http://www.newsgator.com/) (which adds its own comments section to your posts--definitely don't like that).
