All day I hear the noise of sirens making moan.

And out of this clutter, you instinctively learn what to ignore and when to prick up your ears. There was a morning about five years ago when the sirens started and just would not stop. I already knew, in the shower, that something was up when I got the call to see what was happening on the teevee and out the front window.

Too close, too long, or both. It's weird how many times NY's bravest have visited our building and our block. Tonight, they arrived en masse to check out the steam coming out of the front of George N Antiques. The guys were toting their adzes, so I was hoping for some action. But after buzzing around like bees for no more than 7 minutes, they were off. No doubt to burn some books somewhere else.
