Phil writes, _"Hey Ches, greetings. Hope all is fabulous in your world. Just was dropping in on the Cyberkrunk world as I am inclined to do and thought "I wonders what Ches is listening to these days?". Then I thoughts, " If I'm wondering this, then chances are others are wondering the same." Perhaps an everchanging top 5 section of what's on yer turntable that is making you shake yer tailfeather type of thing. Perhaps I should mind my own business. Love Phil_

Well Phil, if that is your real name, it's funny that you mention this, because it's been something I have been planning for quite a while. Hopefully, your note will prod me to actually do something about it this weekend. In the meantime, keep watching the skies!
