Speaking of reducing things to little tiny bits: both the [New Yorker](http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2007/05/14/070514fa_fact_kolbert) and the [Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/15/science/15cern.html?_r=1&hp&oref=login) have recently featured nice articles on [CERN](http://public.web.cern.ch/Public/Welcome.html)'s [Large Hadron Collider](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_Hadron_Collider). Mmm... Hadrons...
