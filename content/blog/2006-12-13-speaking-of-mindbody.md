_Turn off your mind, relax and float down stream; it is not dying, it is not dying.

Lay down all thought, surrender to the void; it is shining, it is shining.

That you may see the meaning of within; it is being, it is being.

That love is all and love is everyone; it is knowing, it is knowing.

That ignorance and hate may mourn the dead; it is believing, it is believing.

But listen to the color of your dreams; it is not living, it is not living.

Or play the game existence to the end; of the beginning..._
