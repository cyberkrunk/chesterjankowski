No posting lately, due to extreme business, which is always a good thing. What drew me out of seclusion? After having fooled around with iTunes for a while, I'm worried that some might construe this as a tacit endorsement. Hardly! I'll tell you why. For some reason, I was just now struck with the need to listen to "The Prophet's Song" from _A Night at the Opera_. Arghh! Something's wrong! [Where's the k-boom?](http://www.gargaro.com/MaRvInWaVs/boom.wav) Where's the creamy indulgence? I ran to the CD rack and started A/Bing between iTunes and the CD. No comparison whatsoever. The reverb is gone, the stereo image is messed with. Sorry kids, if all we ever had was mp3, we never would have had _A Night at the Opera._
