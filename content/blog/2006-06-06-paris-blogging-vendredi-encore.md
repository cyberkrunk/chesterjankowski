Back in the city of lights again. This time, decided to be good citizens and took the [RER](http://www.ratp.info/orienter/rer.php?partenaire=#) into town. The problem isn't so much with the RER as lugging the bags up an down the stairs of the metro. And when we got to [Gare Montparnasse](http://www.paris.org/Gares/Montparnasse/), decided it was a bit far and took a cab anyway. Going home tomorrow, we'll just cab it to [Denfert Rocherau](http://www.channels.nl/paris/denfert_rochereau.html), then take the RER to CDG. It will still beat the 55 â‚¬ cab fare all the way to the airport. During our afternoon stroll, which started out with a couple of fougasses to keep the vultures away, we passed through [rue](http://michel.benardfr.free.fr/blog/wp-content/photos/IMG_07311.jpg) [Montsouris](http://perso.numericable.fr/~bdecorte/Photos/ruesqmonts.jpg). You could visit Paris a hundred times and not find all the charming hidden treasures like this little "private" street lined with houses from the 1920s, each with beautiful gardens and vines. Also passed through [Cite Universitaire](http://www.ciup.fr/) before stopping on [Rue Daguerre](http://www.daguerre-village.com/?Rpage=alimentation.html) for a quick drink.

Tonight's main event will be a celebratory feast of [Bouillabaisse](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bouillabaisse) at the Montparnasse legend, Le Dôme. Eggads! Time to head out now! To the fishmobile!
