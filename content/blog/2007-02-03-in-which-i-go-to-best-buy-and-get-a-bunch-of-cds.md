Stones: Get Yer Ya-Ya’s Out; Sticky Fingers; Exile on Main Street; Black and Blue. I’m filling out the [Mick Taylor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mick_Taylor) period here. Now have pretty much everything I need, Stones-wise. Although I do still pine occasionally for the octagonal “Through the Past Darkly” that I bought in the Village on my very first trip to NYC. I'm still not sure how I feel about Tyalor's playing. Despite his oft-mentioned [Bluesbreakers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Mayall) pedigree, his solos tend to be [noodly](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Momofuku_Ando) and [scalar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalar_%28mathematics%29). If I want to hear [that](http://www.dead.net/), I can just pick up my own damn [axe](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gibson_SG).

RATM: Rage Against the Machine; Evil Empire; The Battle of Los Angeles; Renegades; Live at the Grand Olympic Auditorium. That’s right--all of ‘em all at once. I did that with the Police, bought all their CDs from Amazon. I got an email back saying “Dear Corporate or Library Buyer, we noticed…” Saving stuff is great. I always knew that I would love these guys. And I do. Love. These guys... [Tom Morello](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Morello) is a very creative player, but see below. [WAKE UP!!!](http://www.sing365.com/music/lyric.nsf/Wake-Up-lyrics-Rage-Against-The-Machine/5DEEF6DADE2463E9482568A50012BF98)

Hendrix: Band of Gypsies. Can you think of a better way to ring in the new year 1970? Jimi Hendrix live at the [Fillmore East](http://www.fillmore-east.com/). Listening to Tom Morello, I think, "cool, he's using a ring modulator--that's creative." Then I put on Band of Gypsies and Jimi's first solo is ring modulated. In case you're wondering, btw, Jimi really is that good. Players as diverse as Morello and Stevie Ray Vaughan can cop mere aspects of style, with plenty left over for the rest of us to steal.

Faces: A Nod is as Good as a Wink…. Because I’m into that whole Jeff Beck -> Rod Stewart -> Ron Wood -> Stones thing.

Queen: A Day at the Races. Because I’m a huge Marx Brothers fan.

Stevie Winwood: The Best of, The Millennium Collection. I’m not a fan of retrospective collections, but I need me some Stevie.

CSNY: So Far. Same as above.

Jeff Beck: Wired; Beck’s Guitar Shop. Uhm, it’s Jeff Beck. I don’t have to defend anything here.

Echo and the Bunnymen: Porcupine; Ocean Rain. Because I’ve been enjoying “Crocodiles” since picking it up in an Atlanta Borders two summers ago.

Bill Frisell, Ron Carter, Paul Motian: Bill Frisell, Ron Carter, Paul Motian. Because everyone needs a little [Bill Frisell](http://www.billfrisell.com/), [Ron Carter](http://www.roncarter.net/officialSite.html), [Paul Motian](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Motian).

The Who: Who Are You. How did I not have this already? Although, I must admit that I'm rather down on them at this point. I think it's rather sad that "they" are touring again.

Bachman - Turner Overdrive: The Anthology. Because it’s the kind of thing that [Will](http://http-server.carleton.ca/~wechard) would get.

Gentle Giant: Free Hand. Wow. What a record.

Credit remaining on my Best Buy gift card: $20. Why the hell else do you think I was buying CDs at Best Buy?
