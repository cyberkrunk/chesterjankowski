I’m doing a re-read of Hindemith's *Craft of Musical Composition*, which I didn’t find terribly useful the first time I read it. He opens with a discussion of acoustics and the overtone series. That made me want to do a deeper dive on acoustics, and remind myself of cones vs. cylinders and all of that. Doing a search, I came across a very nice resource on [music acoustics](https://www.phys.unsw.edu.au/jw/basics.html) from the University of New South Wales. Lots to explore there.
