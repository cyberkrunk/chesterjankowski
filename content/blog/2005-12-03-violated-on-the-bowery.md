Just got back from seeing those Depeche-mode-playin' gals at a newish club called [Crash Mansion](http://www.crashmansion.com/). [Professor E.](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0253217687/qid=1133629282/sr=2-1/ref=pd_bbs_b_2_1/103-4445804-2358261?s=books&v=glance&n=283155) was crashed out on a couch as we checked out the opening act, a U2 cover band that doesn't seem to realize it's a U2 cover band. Ho hum. [Violator](http://www.violatorgirls.com/) hit the stage and this new iteration is the best one yet. This is the third guitarist I've seen them with, and she coaxed some nice textures out of her [LP](http://www.gibson.com/Products/GibsonElectric/Gibson%20Electric%20Guitars/LesPaul/Standards/Standard/)\->Pod->[Twin](http://www.fender.com/products/search.php?partno=0215700000) setup. PG's bass sounded better than ever, with a nice Korn-like crunch. Tracy the drummer, whose birthday was the excuse for this here gig, rocked steady as ususal. Then t'was out into the cold street and into a warm cab to zoom back uptown and tuck the Prof into another cozy crash pad. As for me, I'm going to browse ["How to play Bebop"](http://www.playjazz.com/AL017.html) for a while longer...
