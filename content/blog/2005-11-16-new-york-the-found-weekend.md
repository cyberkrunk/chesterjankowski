BA [captures](http://www.bertarcher.net/?p=177) much of what's great about PJ's, but he missed my favourite part, which is that PJ's is the set for [Nat's Bar](http://www.pjclarkes.com/htm/m04/lost_weekend.html) in [The Lost Weekend.](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0037884/trivia) (And for the record, I think Nora's super, too.)
