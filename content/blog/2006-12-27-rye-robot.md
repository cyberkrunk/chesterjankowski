From the "two-post-in-one-day!" department:

Reading through Eric Asimov's year end wine wrap-up, I'm more interested his November state-of-the-union column about [Rye](http://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/29/dining/29wine.html?ex=1167368400&en=6a95251c49a37a3c&ei=5070) whiskey. If you've never had a Manhattan made with Rye, then you've never had a proper Manhattan. Most people seem to prefer them with Bourbon these days, but Bourbon is a little too big and rounded, not sharp like a Rye (to put in in wine terms, if Bourbon is an Australian Shiraz, then Rye is a Rhone Syrah). Maybe we'll stop off at [Keens](http://www.keens.com/history.html) on our way to the show tonight...
