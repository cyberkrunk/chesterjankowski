I'm having dinner the other night at Emma's Pizza in Cambridge, Ma. Funny place, college hangout featuring thin-crust pizza, mis-matched chairs, and the geekiest collage of 20-something nerds (everyone of them paying by credit card) I had seen in a long time. The service has been described as "Kafka-esque"--it's not, it's just incompetent, but pleasant enough for being so. The service gave me plenty of time to listen to the tunes they were playing, which were pretty good. The first tune that really caught my ear was one I had heard before, but I had no idea what it was. I thought maybe it was some remix of a 60s tune. It had this great refrain of "no, no, no", sung way behind the beat. Who is this? I Googled on my Blackerry, "Who sings that song that goes no, no, no?" What an age we live in. A few hits down, Google confirmed what I had sort of suspected, it's the Amy Winehouse song, "Rehab".

Now, I had seen pictures of Amy--who hasn't?--and heard about all the brouhaha about her Grammy wins. Let's just say, I was not predisposed to like her. The music, however, completely won me over, and the CD was waiting for me when I got home Friday night. Dipping into the rest of the album, there are some fine moments and at least a few insanely great lyrics, "What kind of fuckery is this / you made me miss the Slick Rick gig!"

I don't know if it's a function of our age or my age, but derivative pop music no longer bothers me, I actually really like it. My favorite bands of the last few years would have had me sneering back in my teens: Interpol is a Joy Division ripoff, the Yeah Yeah Yeahs rip everybody off, The Whigs singer in the post below is an amalgam of Neil Young and Thurston Moore. So What? As Donald "Duck" Dunn famously said, "If the shit fits, wear it!"
