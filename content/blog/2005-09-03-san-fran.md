"Welcome to the most beautiful city in the world." Just after touching down, the lead of the front attendant crew came over the P.A. and uttered this in his thick Russian brogue. I already liked this guy for his sense of humor--playing up his accent for comic relief in a Bronson Pichot kind of way, weirdly dragging out Sun... Frun... Seesco every time. And there's something to what he said, which you can already begin to see on final approach. This nicely sprawling city nestled in the California coastal mountains.

"Welcome to the capital of the world!" he announced as we landed at JFK. Not sure if that's quite true either, but I didn't really mind.
