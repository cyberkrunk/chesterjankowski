From the “wow-this-took-longer-than-I-thought-it-would” department:

Welcome to the new home of cyberkrunk! As you can see, we have gone completely from one extreme (simple html) to the other (a full-function blog~portal). I hope that everyone finds useful and entertaining stuff here...

What should you post here? Well, how about news, upcoming gigs, CD releases, reviews (music, books, films, concerts, restaurants), or whatever else you’re working on and would like to share. Click on the ‘contribute story’ link at the bottom of the page to get started.

Stay tuned for more to come.
