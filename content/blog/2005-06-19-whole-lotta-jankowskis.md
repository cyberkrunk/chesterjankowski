More than 85,000 people tried to get in to this year's NY Marathon, and among those were a record number of Jankowskis. Five of us are in, three will have to sit out. My goal this year? Well, of course to be the first Jankowski at Tavern on the Green. But take heart, fellow runners, whether you be a Yankofski, or a Jankowski, my training this year hasn't been exemplary, so you have a good chance. Here's the list:
