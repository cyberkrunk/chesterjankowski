As much as I was allured by the ubergeek appeal of running a site based on slashcode,  it  eventually became more trouble than it was worth.  For a couple of reasons, I needed to update my server to the most recent version of Redhat Fedora. Slash only runs on a very specific, and very ancient version of mysql--a version which is impossible to run on Fedora Core 6. Besides which, slash is written entirely in Perl, and makes no use of CSS. Hardly ideal. So, I had been thinking for some time about switching to a completely LAMP (Linux, Apache, Mysql, PHP) platform and, after doing some digging around, ended up choosing Wordpress. It was a piece of cake to get up and running and, thanks to CSS, it will be simple  to re-design the site. Unfortunately, there's no way to auto-import the posts from my slash site, so I will be re-posting some old chestnuts and may eventually get around to reposting everything.

And now, back to the krunk...
