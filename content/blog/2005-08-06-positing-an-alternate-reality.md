August 6th was the anniversary of two days of infamy. About August 6th, 1945, the title of a book I read as a teenager sums it up: "The Day Man Lost". More recently, August 6th 2001 was the day that President Bush, on vacation at Crawford TX, received the infamous Presidential Daily Briefing that warned of bin Laden's intentions. Having ignored bin Laden up to that date in his presidency, on that day he continued to do the same and finished off his vacation.

Here is the portion of the PDB that has been declassified (emphasis mine):

> # Bin Laden determined to strike in US
> 
> Clandestine, foreign government, and media reports indicate bin Laden since 1997 has wanted to conduct terrorist attacks in the US. Bin Laden implied in U.S. television interviews in 1997 and 1998 that his followers **would follow the example of World Trade Center bomber Ramzi Yousef and "bring the fighting to America."**
> 
> After U.S. missile strikes on his base in Afghanistan in 1998, **bin Laden told followers he wanted to retaliate in Washington**, according to a -- -- service.
> 
> An Egyptian Islamic Jihad (EIJ) operative told - - service at the same time that bin Laden was planning to exploit the operative's access to the U.S. to mount a terrorist strike.
> 
> The millennium plotting in Canada in 1999 may have been part of bin Laden's first serious attempt to implement a terrorist strike in the U.S.
> 
> Convicted plotter Ahmed Ressam has told the FBI that he conceived the idea to attack Los Angeles International Airport himself, but that in ---, Laden lieutenant Abu Zubaydah encouraged him and helped facilitate the operation. Ressam also said that in 1998 Abu Zubaydah was planning his own U.S. attack.
> 
> Ressam says bin Laden was aware of the Los Angeles operation. Although Bin Laden has not succeeded, his attacks against the U.S. Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998 demonstrate that he prepares operations years in advance and is not deterred by setbacks. Bin Laden associates surveyed our embassies in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam as early as 1993, and some members of the Nairobi cell planning the bombings were arrested and deported in 1997.
> 
> Al Qaeda members -- including some who are U.S. citizens -- have resided in or traveled to the U.S. for years, and the group apparently maintains a support structure that could aid attacks.
> 
> Two al-Qaeda members found guilty in the conspiracy to bomb our embassies in East Africa were U.S. citizens, and a senior EIJ member lived in California in the mid-1990s.
> 
> A clandestine source said in 1998 that a bin Laden cell in New York was recruiting Muslim-American youth for attacks.
> 
> We have not been able to corroborate some of the more sensational threat reporting, such as that from a ---- service in 1998 saying that **Bin Laden wanted to hijack a U.S. aircraft** to gain the release of "Blind Sheikh" Omar Abdel Rahman and other U.S.-held extremists.
> 
> Nevertheless, **FBI information since that time indicates patterns of suspicious activity in this country consistent with preparations for hijackings or other types of attacks, including recent surveillance of federal buildings in New York.**
> 
> The FBI is conducting approximately 70 full-field investigations throughout the U.S. that it considers bin Laden-related. **CIA and the FBI are investigating a call to our embassy in the UAE in May saying that a group or bin Laden supporters was in the U.S. planning attacks with explosives.**

Re-reading the last two paragraphs, does it not seem that Condolezza Rice committed perjury during her testimony to the 9/11 commission? Up until that moment, we all had heard rumors of the Aug 6 PDB, but until she uttered it, we didn't know the now famous title. Rice's filibuster-style testimony was full of protests to the effect that the Aug 6 PDB was "historical" and didn't warn of coming attacks. To wit:

> Rice: You said, did it not warn of attacks. It did not warn of attacks inside the United States. It was historical information based on old reporting. There was no new threat information. And it did not, in fact, warn of any coming attacks inside the United States.

Peace out...
