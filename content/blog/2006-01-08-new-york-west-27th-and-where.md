We were somewhere around 10th Avenue on the edge of Chelsea when the Super Tuscan began to take hold. But let me take a step back. Every once in a while on my travels, a thought along the lines of, "after all, there are decent restaurants in _other_ cities" enters my mind. But then I go to a place like [Naima](http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=naima+new+york&btnG=Google+Search), and I am back to thinking of NYC, "Look upon my works, ye Mighty, and despair!" Yes, it's all that--and a packet of crisps. On that crosstown trip, the cabbie kept asking, "27th and where?" But after dinner, the guy taking us back to [chez Mark](http://www.mwienerarts.com/) informed us that [Bungalow 8](http://www.google.com/search?q=bungalow+8&sourceid=mozilla-search&start=0&start=0&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&client=firefox-a&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official), which is next door, is "the most fabulous club in New York." Which is perhaps why a cabbie was trawling W27th between 10th & 11th. Doesn't matter, because I am not Prince [Black Card](http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&hs=QET&client=firefox-a&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&q=amex+black+card+centurion&spell=1), nor was meant to be. Also, somehow, there is now a 'Scores' on that block. But we'll just ignore that. And we'll be back...
