Dogville is the kind of film which leaves you completely bowled over, in that "wow..." state. Especially the "..." part. When Lars von Trier engages you, you feel it, viscerally, of course, but you are also left with many things to ponder. A heated coffee-shop philosophy chat that ends with chairs being smashed over heads. Or a few kidney punches. Some bruises at the very least. And as much as I would love to get into the ideas of this picture, I wouldn't dare to give away a word of it. So please, everyone, once you've seen it, let's talk. We'll try to keep the violence level down, I promise. In the meantime, I'm going to see more of LVT's flics.
