Some things need to be _blogged_ in quasi-realtime, and this is surely one of them. Just got back from a silly, trendy club on W58th st. Ha ha. SF, who, being a recent NY transplant from San Fran, and whom therefore I like to think of as S.Fo, decided to damn the torpeedos and go full speed ahead with sparking a cig _inside_ the club--this despite dire warnings from N. and me. It was classic. Less than 30" later, a waiter, maybe busboy, trotted over, grabbed it, and dropped it, without saying a word, into a glass of water. Then walked off. Too funny.
