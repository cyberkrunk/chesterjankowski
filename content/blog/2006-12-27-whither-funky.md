From the "take-it-down-to-the-bridge" department:

As the New Yorker informs us every week, _"Musicians and night-club proprietors lead complicated lives; it's desirable to call ahead to confirm engagements."_ Looking at BB King's website, it seems Eartha Kitt will do the New Year's Eve show instead. (And if your eyesight is _really_ good, you can see who we're catching tonight at BB's.)
