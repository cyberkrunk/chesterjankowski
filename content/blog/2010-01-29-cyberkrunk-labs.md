Things are humming along, and the bf album release is getting nearer. Maybe this year.

The labs have had a major influx of new gear of the past year. The most recent addition is a pair of [Dynaudio BM 6A mk II](http://www.dynaudioacoustics.com/bm6amkii.asp) nearfield monitors. Now, back in the day, many happy hours were spent in the depths of [UTEMS](http://www.music.utoronto.ca/about/facilities/studio.htm) in front of a pair of [Genelec 1030a](http://www.genelec.com/products/previous-models/1030a/)s, which have served as my high water mark for nearfields ever since.

Well, let's just say that Denmark is not too far from Finland: the Dynaudios are a perfect match for my space, I absolutely love listening to them. They are small, but the bass is accurate and the imaging and detail are bang on.

"Pusherman" just came on iTunes, and the sound of Curtis in my head is what prompted the post.
