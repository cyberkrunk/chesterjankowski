I had a busy week in NYC seeing great jazz and then writing about it in a new blog that Nora Maynard and I are launching called [cultured nyc](http://www.culturednyc.com).

First off, I caught two nights of the legendary [Barry Harris at the Village Vanguard](https://www.culturednyc.com/barry-harris-at-the-village-vanguard/). Then, I saw the amazing hard-bop sextet [One For All at Dizzy's](https://www.culturednyc.com/one-for-all-celebrates-art-blakey-at-dizzys/), in honor of Art Blakey's centenary. Finally, I saw [Dave Stryker](http://www.culturednyc.com/dave-stryker-trio-at-the-bar-next-door/) with his organ trio at the Bar Next Door. All in all, a great week!
