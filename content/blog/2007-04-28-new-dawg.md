Spent the day putting my new [Digital Audio Workstation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Audio_Workstation) (DAW), [Cubase 4](http://www.steinberg.net/), through its paces and you can [hear](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cyberkrunk.com/images/articles/Tea_and_Symphony.mp3) the results yourself. Only took a few hours to get the audio set up to match my studio and learn the basics of looping, audio tracks, MIDI tracks, mix automation, inserts, sends, mixdown, the whole works. I have to say I'm pretty impressed, which is good considering it costs same as a couple of nights at the St. Regis. It should be pretty clear where I pilfered the chord progression, but for bonus points can you name the drum loop?

Do you think it needs more guitar?
