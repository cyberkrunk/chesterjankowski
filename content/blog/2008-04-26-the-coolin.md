Come with me, under my coat, And we will drink our fill Of the milk of the white goat, Or wine if it be thy will

And we will talk, until Talk is a trouble, too, Out on the side of the hill; And nothing is left to do,

But an eye to look into an eye; And a hand in a hand to slip; And a sigh to answer a sigh; And a lip to find out a lip!

What if the night be black! Or the air on the mountain chill! Where the goat lies down in her track, And all but the fern is still!

Stay with me, under my coat! And we will drink our fill Of the milk of the white goat, Out on the side of the hill!
