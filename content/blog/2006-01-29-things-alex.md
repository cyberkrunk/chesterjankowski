It was, perhaps, three years or so ago and I was having a sleepless night. (No, this isn't about Dostoevsky's "White Nights" and if you don't know that and the rest of his short fiction, well, that's just rather sad.) I've been a longtime convert of the school of "if ye cannot sleep, then get ye the heck out of bed"--avoiding bad habits and all that. This one particular night, I spent 90 minutes or so reading ["Things My Girlfriend And I Have Argued About"](http://www.thingsmygirlfriendandihavearguedabout.com/). It doesn't look like it has been updated in a long, long time. But thank goodness it's still there.
