Owing mostly to an administrative error, and, I guess, partially to my "only-dining-below-14th-street" edict that was passed as of late, we ended up having dinner at [Marion's](http://marionsnyc.com/) tonight. Now, the thing you have to know about Marion's is that it has always been a fun place to have a cocktail--a wacky cocktail, that is. I would never have a simple "Sapphire-martini-up-with-olives" there. But the menu has always--how shall we say, sucked. How far off the mark can they be? Well, let's look to their [cocktail menu](http://marionsnyc.com/page/nv1p/Martinis.html) as an example: the "Smoky Martini":

Ketel One vodka straight up with a drop of laphroaig.

Oy gevalt!
