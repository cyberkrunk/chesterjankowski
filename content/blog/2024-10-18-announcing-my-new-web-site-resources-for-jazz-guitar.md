I'm now ready to start sharing a new web project that I've been working on for some time: [https://resourcesforjazzguitar.com](https://resourcesforjazzguitar.com). This is my jazz guitar pedagogy site, and will feature a good mix of serious music theory related to jazz guitar, as well as practice materials. I hope anyone doing serious study at the intermediate to advance level finds it useful.
