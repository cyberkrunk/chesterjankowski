[Bert](http://www.bertarcher.net/)'s travel piece in yesterday's Globe and Mail on [seven deadly sins getaways](http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20070113.wxsintravel13/BNStory/specialTravel/home) has a nice resonance with [Orson Welles](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orson_Welles)' [Lady from Shanghai](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0040525/). To represent the sin of greed, Bert picks the Chinese city of [Macau](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macau). This immediately brings to mind the classic exchange between Welles and his real-life estranged wife, Rita Hatworth:

> Michael O'Hara: I bet you l´ve been to the place you were born.
> 
> Elsa Bannister: Cheefoo.
> 
> Michael O'Hara: lt´s on the China coast. It´s the second wickedest city.
> 
> Elsa Bannister: What´s the first?
> 
> Michael O'Hara: Macao.
> 
> Elsa Bannister: I worked there.
> 
> Michael O'Hara: You worked in Macao?
> 
> Elsa Bannister: Here´s your dollar. How about Shanghai?
> 
> Michael O'Hara: I worked there too.
