Just watched Moonlight, and, happily, it's great. Need to watch it again on short order. Don't know if composer Nicholas Britell truly had Vaughan Williams' Fantasia on a Theme by Thomas Tallis in his ear as he wrote the score, but I had to listen to that piece right away on finishing the film. It fit right in.
