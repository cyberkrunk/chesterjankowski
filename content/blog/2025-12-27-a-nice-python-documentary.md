description: Since Youtube has been inundated with slop, here’s a good documentary on Python that seems to have been made by humans.

I’ve been doing more and more work in Python this year, and plan to continue doing still more in 2026. I'm developing a library for my own work in composing and music theory.

Today, I did a search on Youtube for videos about the origins and history of Python. In late 2025, Youtube now seems to have more LLM slop than anything else, or at least, that’s what it’s recommendation algorithm would have us think. To combat this, I wrote a little script, in Python, to automate the generation of a [uBlock Origin](https://ublockorigin.com/) filter for Youtube; once I find a channel that does slop videos, I don’t want to ever see them again.

A few hits down, however, I did manage to find [Python: The Documentary](https://youtu.be/GfH4QL4VqJ0), which is worth a watch if you would like to learn more about the history of the language.
