_From the, "Then again, maybe I won't... department."_

Cyberkunk industry insiders have known since December 2004 about plans to re-locate the global headquarters of cyberkrunk Labs, Inc. to Paris. The cyberkrunk corporate communications department reports that cyberkrunk will actually remain in midtown Manhattan. This decision came after detailed analysis of a contract proposal that centered on cost of living comparisons between the two cities. While the proposed move was highly attractive on a personal and professional level, the numbers simply didn't work out.

Paris remains one of my favorite places, but we're _not_ at all displeased about staying in the world's capital, NYC.
