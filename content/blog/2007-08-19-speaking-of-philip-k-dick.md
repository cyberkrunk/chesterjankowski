Funny how everything good comes from some place else. One of the best scenes in John Carpenter's Dark Star involves a conversation with the ship's dead captain. Beyond being understandably groggy, he's a bit put out that no one has talked to him for so long. Still, he offers good advice, that is, to teach the bomb phenomenology. I won't explain. Apparently, Dick's 1969 novel Ubik also features communication with the dead -- with the same kind of crappy service and screw ups as it will have when Time Warner Cable offers it as aÂ  part of its "cradle to the grave" bundle in 2037.

This has been another edition of blogging while delayed at LGA.
