Fair daffodils, we weep to see you haste away so soon; as yet the early-rising sun has not attain'd his noon. Stay, stay until the hasting day has run but to the evensong; and, having pray'd together, we Will go with you along. We have short time to stay, as you, we have as short a spring; as quick a growth to meet decay, as you, or anything. We die as your hours do, and dry away like to the summer's rain; or as the pearls of morning's dew, ne'er to be found again.
