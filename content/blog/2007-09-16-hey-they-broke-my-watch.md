Spending a lot of time in Chicago these days, as is Ms. Celluloid Pantry. So that's enough to prompt the semi-annual screening of the Blues Brothers. Just noticed , after watching this movie maybe 50 times already, that right after John Candy's immortal "This is car 55. We're in a truck." line, another cop is heard to utter, "hey, they broke my watch!", in a recapitulation of the gag from the mall drive-through scene. What other gems will Cinema 59's recent upgrades reveal?
