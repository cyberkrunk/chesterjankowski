From the "old-man-and-the-Sea-Breeze" department.

Holding court at the [Roof Lounge](http://travel2.nytimes.com/top/features/travel/destinations/canada/ontario/toronto/entertainment_details.html?vid=1083856085992) tonight--the one truly great bar in [Toronto](http://epguides.com/KingofKensington/). [Sandra Oh](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0644897/) and friends were at the next table, but the real celebs were sitting with us, namely composer-turned-pipe-organ-tuner [JMS](http://www.neithernor.com/sherlock/) and Can-lit-crit gadfly and man-about-town [BA](http://www.bertarcher.net/). I know that Sandra is a devoted Cyberkrunk reader, so I didn't bother her (like that tiresome other couple) with my idea: over the course of your next few movies, Sandra, please pummel to a bloody pulp the rest of the cast of [Wings](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098948/). Old Ernest would have appproved (and then he'd get drunk and forget all about it).
