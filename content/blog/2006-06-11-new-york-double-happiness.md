[Sometimes](http://www.nymag.com/listings/bar/double_happiness/), you get [lucky](http://www.gothamist.com/archives/2005/02/25/ask_your_bartender_heather_double_happiness.php) and just [stumble](http://www.frommers.com/destinations/newyorkcity/N24423.html) into [a place](http://www.worldsbestbars.com/city/new-york/double-happiness-new-york.htm) at 11:00 o'clock on a Saturday night and get the [best seat in the house](http://newyork.citysearch.com/profile/7113474/) (scroll down to "where to sit"). BA knows what I'm talkin' about. Yes, DH's peak has come and gone, but hey, "...cast the first stone." and all that.
