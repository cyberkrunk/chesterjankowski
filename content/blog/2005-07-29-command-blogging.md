When the second best writer I know tells me to blog more, dammit, I'd better do as I've been told. Especially when I see cyberkrunk linked at the top, mind you, of his blogroll. I teared up a little when I saw that. But maybe it was just continuing ill after-effects of that late Wednesday night in Nashville. (It turns out, by the way, that a round or two of bowling is the perfect desert after ingesting bad tempanyaki {which was misidentified as "Hibachi".})

More on Nashville in the weeks to come. But for now, I will only note this. Air travel in this country is badly broken. Much more on that...
