Strange to have been so excited about seeing a band so notoriously aloof and disconnected from their audience. But the truth is, the disconnection is all surface, not quite masking the real connection, through the music. Carnegie Hall might have been a more appropriate venue. When a chamber group is playing, no one remarks how the band tends to look off in the distance while playing, or how they don't shout slogans at the audience between songs ("Hey Amsterdam! Yeah -- I always heard that Concertgebouw audiences are the best chamber audiences in the world!"). [Tom Verlaine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Verlaine) crouched down, hiding himself behind his stage monitor, to tune his guitar after every song. He was switching between standard and drop D tunings fairly often, so this wasn't entirely artifice, but still, this is a man who clearly does not revel in being on stage. At 57, he seems to have finally grown into himself. His attitude must have seemed a little bizarre when he was in his twenties, but now he has a David-Carradine-like stature. The set was not craven pandering, either. Long, jammy tunes, including some newer stuff, leaving off some of the great songs of [Marquee Moon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marquee_Moon)\--no "See No Evil", "Friction" or "Elevation". And the finale, their legendary debut album title track, was awesome, especially the moments after the climax where Verlaine veered off into an improvised ending, leaving his bandmates completely bewildered (I was at the front and saw the look of terror of Fred Smith and Billy Ficca's faces). Patti Smith, off to the side of the stage smiled approvingly.

[Television](http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=11:fifqxqr5ldse) concerts are, these days, rare events. They have been playing together once a year or so for the last few years. This concert, however, was to hold a special significance: the last Television show ever. So wrote Richard Lloyd on his [web site:](http://www.richardlloyd.com/)

> After the possible Summer stage show in New York City on June 16, which is to be announced by the city of New York on May 15, Richard Lloyd will, after 34 years, be amicably severing all ties with the band Television, in order that he may concentrate his magnetic force and supernatural energies upon his own career in support of his forthcoming record, due out in the fall\[...\] To the fans of Television, from the very first show at the townhouse Theatre on March 4, 1974 till the hopeful last show here in New York at the Summer stage -- which by the way, is a free show, thank you for your support over these many years. I hope to see you follow both my own and the other members of the band in their own solo efforts for many more years to come.

But it was not to be. Lloyd has recently been in intensive care with pneumonia, is still in hospital and could not make the concert. Do we get a do-over?

Opening for Television were [Dragons of Zynth](http://www.myspace.com/dragonsofzynth) (crazy) and [Apples in Stereo](http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll) (ba-hor-rah-hing).
