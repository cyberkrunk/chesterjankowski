From the "g-l-o-r-i-a-,-or-a-trip-to-Virgin-on-the-way-home-from-Union-Square-my-God-I-love-New-York" department.

Dexter Gordon's [_Our Man in Paris_](http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&token=&sql=10:4t62mpsd9f1o), and Sonny Rollins' [Way Out West](http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:jpdayl14xpnb) need no apologia, nor does, I think, [Horses](http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:l60e4jn70wa4). So why add, listen to, or otherwise promote [Damn the Torpedoes](http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:9yom968o3ep2)? It's not just because I'm such a huge fan of [_The More The Merrier_](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0036172/), I swear! Although, admittedly, that can't hurt (come on, Jean Arthur, Joel McCrea _and_ Charles Coburn?). It's no Petty nostalgia, that drove me to it, it's the tone. I remember when this album {not their first \[but their third (a typical 10-year "overnight sensation")\], as I mistakenly thought} came out and how it epitomized "good music", commercial "good music", that is. The guitar tracks on "Refugee" and "Here Comes My Girl" are what it's all about. That's right. And the B3 sits nicely in the middle ground. So, 'scuse me while I kiss this guy, alright?
