The Cedar Lounge--every city, big or small, must have had its own CBGB's in the late '70s and early '80s. This was London, Ontario's punk rock incubator. It was already closed down, and a legend, by the time I got anywhere near old enough to go to a bar or a rock club. And of all the rag-tag (sorry for the Battlestar Galactica reference, but it seemed right) groups associated with that London Aunt punk scene, the marquee band has to have been The Demics. "Demics Rule!" was spray-painted, I think, on the same downtown alley wall as the more cryptic invocation, "Wet Dog Fur." Could it be [this song](http://chrwradio.com/mp3/1980/The%20Demics%20-%20The%20Demics/The%20Demics%20-%20New%20York%20City4.mp3) that programmed my young, malleable brain with the mission to move to NYC? Well, let's just say that it was a further data point. Thanks to CHRW, you can now listen to that whole album [here](http://chrwradio.com/mp3/1980/The%20Demics%20-%20The%20Demics/demics4.htm).

What was the punk club in your home town that you were too young to frequent?
