_And here you have post 100:_

Back in the late 1980s, [Louis Malle](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001501/) was the first French film director I got to know over a span of films and a [span of time](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118789/quotes). He inspired me to get into French film generally, and a few of his pics hold special places in my heart. Now for some mysterious reason, his films had not been available over [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparta) on DVD. Who knows why, but the situation has finally been fixed. The [Criterion](http://www.criterionco.com/) [Collection](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criterion_Collection) has just come out with two DVDs: [3 Films by Louis Malle](http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?link_code=ur2&tag=cyberkrunk09-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB000E1YVZK%2Fqid%3D1150037643%2Fsr%3D8-1%2Fref%3Dpd_bbs_1%3F%255Fencoding%3DUTF8%26v%3Dglance%26n%3D130) and [Elevator to the Gallows](http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?link_code=ur2&tag=cyberkrunk09-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB000E5LEVA%2Fqid%3D1150037643%2Fsr%3D8-2%2Fref%3Dpd_bbs_2%3F%255Fencoding%3DUTF8%26v%3Dglance%26n%3D130).

Watching the films again through older, [wiser](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irony) eyes, and with a fuller context of French film, and film generally was surprising. It's hard not to see [Le Souffle au coeur](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0067778/) as a rich kid's version of [Les Quatre cents coups](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0053198/). And as much as Truffaut's films were revolutionary, there's a reactionary thread running through these Malle films, as though Louis feels the need to defend his class. In both [Lacombe Lucien](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0071733/) and [Au revoir, les enfants](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092593/), Malle paints ugly, stupid underclass characters that take the blame for the worst sins of the [Vichy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vichy_France) era, while the smartly-dressed upper class look on and shrug. [Ascenseur pour l'Ã©chafaud](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0051378/) is worth watching for the score alone, which Miles Davis improvised. But compare this film to [Ã€ bout de souffle](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0053472/). Where Godard achieves randomness and spontaneity, the Malle film seems contrived. And [Jeanne Moreau](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0603402/) seems to overact her underacting.

I'm not saying this is bad wine, just a little thinner and more tannic than I remember. And so as not to end on a bitter note, here's a perfect French film that you probably don't know: [Bob le Flambeur](http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?link_code=ur2&tag=cyberkrunk09-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB0000633SC%2Fqid%3D1150041425%2Fsr%3D8-1%2Fref%3Dpd_bbs_1%3F%255Fencoding%3DUTF8%26v%3Dglance%26n%3D130).
