I was reading an article by [Dmitri Tymoczko](http://dmitri.tymoczko.com/) this morning, [Stravinsky and the Octatonic: A Reconsideration](http://dmitri.mycpanel.princeton.edu/files/publications/stravinsky.pdf), and came across a useful term: locally diatonic. This refers to a scale whose seconds are all minor or major, and whose thirds are all minor or major. This includes the following scales: major, ascending melodic minor, whole-tone, and diminished (octatonic). Any three consecutive notes from any of these scales can be mapped onto a segment of the major scale.
