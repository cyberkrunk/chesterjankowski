I sure do love me some of that new Sedrick. Just downloaded an album's worth of their new stuff [here](http://www.sedrick.org/sounds.html), and I suggest you do the same. Now! Cool thing is, this stuff was recorded on the new gear that we discussed [here](http://blog.cyberkrunk.com:8081/article.pl?sid=05/04/06/1235240&mode=flat) on cyberkrunk. And it sounds not too shabby. Hey Will, are we hearing any of that new Les Paul on these tracks? Thanks guys!
