From the "paging-George-Kaplan department."

My first trip to the Oak Bar was way back in the twentieth century, during a trip to New York, before I lived here. It was an evening of contrasts: stuffy old expensive midtown, followed by hip, cheap downtown. The three of us had _two_ rounds of cocktails and the tab came to 50 bucks. After that, we headed down to the West Village and had a nice dinner for three with a bottle of wine for the same amount. That's one thing I've always loved about New York, you can find the extremes and all points in between.
