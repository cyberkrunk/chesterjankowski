Emerging from what must be one of the all-time longest work jags, maybe two months non-stop. There is one track destined to become a classic on "The Weirdness", the new Stooges record that completely sums it up: "I'm fried". Good record all around - could be looser, grittier. But what a huge disappointment "A Weekend in the City", the new Bloc Party album is! The vocals are all intimate and close miked. The microphone is not this guy's friend. He sounds much better standing back a few feet and shrieking the way he did throughout Silent Alarm. The songs are all mid tempo, with silly arpeggio riffs that beg to be taken seriously. Just sad. I couldn't sit through the whole album. Instead, I put "Show Your Bones" back on. I cannot get enough of this record. Yeah Yeah Yeah!
