# Prologue-Quietude, 1996.

For 2-channel tape.

This piece is in large part a study on a chord from the late Canadian jazz guitarist Lenny Breau and is inspired by the quietude that Breau's music often sought. The chord is taken from Breau's song "Five O'clock Bells." Two sound sources were used: a series of 17 recorded excerpts of classical guitar (performed by Robert Kubica) and Proteus 1 and 2 synthesizers. The guitar excerpts are mostly delicate tremolo and arpeggio figures. The excerpts were then edited, combined with recorded excerpts from the Proteus synths and mixed using MTU's Microeditor.
