# SPECTRE v. KAOS, 1996.

For 2-channel tape.

While the people at Cyberkrunk labs normally shy away from imposing programmatic interpretations on unsuspecting listeners, it has been suggested that the opening gesture bears resemblance to a reverse-steganophonic process whereby a secret message is intercepted and subsequently decoded. The events that follow culminate in a battle in which progressively larger grains are hurled back and forth. Sound sources were kept to a minimum: 3 short clips which are combined and cross-synthesised in various ways. The primary tools were convolution, spectral mutation and granular synthesis.
