# Christmas Song, 1990.

For 2-channel tape.

Composed while studying electroacoustic music with David Myska at the University of Western Ontario. This was a Christmas present for my mother, based on my favourite Polish Christmas Carol, which you can hear the wind singing on an otherwise quiet winter's night. I recall an Akai S900 sampler and Proteus synthesizers being used.

Duration = 5'44"
