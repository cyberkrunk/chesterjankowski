# Krunk!, 1996.

For 2-channel tape.

I'm open to suggestions. Maybe 'the sound your modem makes as it chokes on a bad init string.' Or 'a non-dairy cheese substitute eaten by brave cybernauts.' At any rate, the title has something to do with a strange usenet group, and Conan O' Brien also figures in somehow. The piece is a live-to-DAT performance using a MAX patch I wrote that uses a chaotic function to generate pitches. The patch allows for realtime control of all the function's parameters, as well as how the function is mapped--MIDI note range, velocity, etc. I used the Emu Morpheus and set up a series of voices that compliment the piece's high voltage energy and sense of humour.

Duration = 7'
