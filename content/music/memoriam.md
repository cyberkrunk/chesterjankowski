# Memoriam, 1991.

For piano and 2-channel tape.

Notes:

My first piece combining a live instrument and tape, Memoriam was written following the death of Sarah Shorten, a philosophy professor and feminist leader at the University of Western Ontario. The dynamic of the piece is simple and straightforward: a powerful "rage against the dying of the light" motive gives way to a more contemplative theme. Memoriam was composed during studies with visiting composer Alexina Louie.

Duration = 8'40"
