# Tiny Steps, 1994.

For bass clarinet, trumpet, percussion and piano.

Notes:

Much of this piece deals with the care and feeding of a musical object. In this case, the "object" is a collection of brief cyclical motives that combine in various ways. "Care and feeding" refers to the minimal treatment that allows the object to thrive on its own energy (mainly kinetic here). The title refers to nothing technical in the piece. Maybe it points to some kind of inverse relationship to the John Coltrane tune.

Tiny Steps was composed for the Array Music Young Composers' Workshop in the summer of 1994. Members of the Array Music ensemble performed the premiere at Toronto's Music Gallery.

Duration = 7' 20"
