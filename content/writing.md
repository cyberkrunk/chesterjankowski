## Music Theory & Criticism

---

[Claude Vivier’s Zipangu](/writing/claude-viviers-zipangu/)  
This analysis of the string ensemble piece Zipangu, by the late Canadian composer [Claude Vivier](http://www.claudevivier.com/), shows how a seemingly rhapsodic piece is tightly controlled in both its pitch and rhythmic material.

## Aesthetics

---

[Mistaking Music: Boundary Conditions of the Aesthetic](/writing/mistaking-music-boundary-conditions-of-the-aesthetic/)  
A discussion of aesthetics stemming from the provocative premise of mistakes in music. [Nelson Goodman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelson_Goodman)’s [Ways of Worldmaking](https://archive.org/details/GoodmanWaysOfWorldmaking) serves as a launching point for a consideration of epistemology and the art object. Following this are some specific topics: music as an analog system; cultural roadblocks; authorial intent and score-reading.

[Notes Toward a Personal Aesthetic](/writing/notes-toward-a-personal-aesthetic/)  
Notes on the development of aesthetics and style for young composers, who must steer a path between inherently conservative training and the challenge of modern styles. Ends with a discussion that seeks to discredit the “music as expression” idea.

[Enter Madmen: Score-reading with Igor](/writing/enter-madmen-score-reading-with-igor/)  
A look at the score to Enter Madmen by Edwin London with Stravinsky’s Poetics as a frame of reference.

## Computer Music

[The Orbit Gallery](/writing/welcome-to-the-orbit-gallery/)
