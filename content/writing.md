## Music Theory & Criticism

---

[Claude Vivier’s Zipangu](https://www.chesterjankowski.com/writing/claude-viviers-zipangu/)  
This analysis of the string ensemble piece Zipangu, by the late Canadian composer Claude Vivier, shows how a seemingly rhapsodic piece is tightly controlled in both its pitch and rhythmic material.

## Aesthetics

---

[Mistaking Music: Boundary Conditions of the Aesthetic](https://www.chesterjankowski.com/writing/mistaking-music-boundary-conditions-of-the-aesthetic/)  
A discussion of aesthetics stemming from the provocative premise of mistakes in music. Nelson Goodman’s Ways of Worldmaking serves as a launching point for a consideration of epistemology and the art object. Following this are some specific topics: music as an analog system; cultural roadblocks; authorial intent and score-reading.

[Notes Toward a Personal Aesthetic](https://www.chesterjankowski.com/writing/notes-toward-a-personal-aesthetic/)  
Notes on the development of aesthetics and style for young composers, who must steer a path between inherently conservative training and the challenge of modern styles. Ends with a discussion that seeks to discredit the “music as expression” idea.

[Enter Madmen: Score-reading with Igor](https://www.chesterjankowski.com/writing/enter-madmen-score-reading-with-igor/)  
A look at the score to Enter Madmen by Edwin London with Stravinsky’s Poetics as a frame of reference.
